A webapp that takes long URLs and shortens them. You can visit the deployed website [here](https://shorturls.danyalakt.com/).
Important note: If you want to actually shorten links, this website works best with very long links. Links that are around the
size of a youtube video link will stay around the same size. Part of the reason the links end up this way is because the domain
I'm hosting this website on has a long name (shorturls.danyalakt.com).

TODO: Links come with http, not https
etc...
